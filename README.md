A <b>BepInEx-Partiality Mod Wrapper</b> for Unity Games. This allows Partiality mods to run in BepInEx.

This version is essentially Partiality packaged <b>as</b> a BepInEx mod. It serves as a dummy reference to Partliality.dll for Partiality Mods, but otherwise behaves as a BepInEx mod.

The HOOKS file included with the release is the current latest one for Outward. If you're using this for a different game you will need to delete that and run the mod once to generate the hooks for your game.

## Install

Installation instructions and the download link can be found here:

## Adding Partiality Mods

Partiality Mod DLL files can be placed either in the `BepInEx\plugins\` folder, or the Partiality `Mods\` folder. Both locations work fine.

However, no matter which folder you use, the DLL files need to be directly inside this folder (not in a sub-folder).

If you use the `BepInEx\plugins\` folder, just note that other non-DLL files in the mod (if any) should be placed wherever the author instructs you to, likely not in the plugins folder.
